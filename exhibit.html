                <p>The necessity for effective waste management systems has increased in recent years as a result of the fast expansion in urbanization and population. In this project, TalakBot, a revolutionary smart garbage can with real-time monitoring capabilities through an easy-to-use Android app, is introduced. TalakBot seeks to change waste management procedures by offering more comfort, increased effectiveness, and optimal resource allocation. TalakBot's capacity to continuously and intelligently check the amount of garbage in the bin is its key feature. The smart trash can is equipped with cutting-edge sensors and Internet of Things (IoT) technology, which allows it to identify and quantify the quantity of rubbish present with great accuracy. The Android app serves as a central control point and gives users easy access to manage and keep an eye on several TalakBot devices at once.</p>

                <p class="ps-5">This study presents an Arduino-based earthquake detector using an accelerometer, buzzer, and SMS module to provide timely notifications during seismic events. The system detects vibrations exceeding predefined thresholds, activating a buzzer for local alerts and triggering an SMS module for remote notifications. The proposed detector offers a cost-effective and easily deployable solution for earthquake detection, contributing to early warning systems and disaster preparedness.</p>
